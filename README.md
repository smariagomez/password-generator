## password-generator

## Project Description

This project required the modification of, and addition to, JavaScript starter code to create an application that allows individuals to generate random passwords based on criteria they have provided through a series of prompts and confirmations. It was particularly challenging to identify why for loop did not appear to be generating more than 1 random character.

## How to Run
Go to site: 
https://smariagomez.github.io/password-generator/

## How to Use

First, the user opens browser to the deployed site. By clicking on the red "Generate Password" button the user will be led through a series of pop up windows. First user will be asked to enter in the number of characters they would like in their password. An alert will pop up if the number entered is not within the parameters. After identifying the number of characters, the user will be asked in sequential order if they would like special characters, numbers, uppercase letters and lowercase letters. After the prompts have been completed, the user will be presented with a randomly generated password that will appear inside of the dotted line box.

## Known Bugs

If the desired length of characters is left blank or if there is a non-numerical entry, a password will not be generated but it will not alert the user what mistake was made.
